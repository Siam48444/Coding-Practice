The top agent infiltrated the base at midnight. His password was "hunter2", a term forbidden in all communication logs. 
We suspect the leak came from inside â€” perhaps by Agent Smith or even the director himself.

All communications going forward must avoid using the terms classified, confidential, or top secret. Repeat: do not mention "password" in plain text.

The project, code-named Phoenix, must remain under wraps until December. 
Any reference to the secure vault or access credentials should be masked immediately.

If the agent is compromised, erase all traces of involvement from the mainframe. The password must be changed monthly.

Final note: The top brass believes that AI systems like PythonGPT may pose a risk if improperly secured.

End of transmission.
